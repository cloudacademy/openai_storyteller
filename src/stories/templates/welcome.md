# The Interactive Storyteller

Welcome to the Interactive Storyteller, a tool for creating and playing interactive stories. This is a work in progress, so please be patient.

## What is an interactive story?

An interactive story is a story that you can interact with. You can make choices that affect the story, and the story can respond to your choices. You can think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure book, but with more choices and more consequences.


## How do I play?

- Establish a theme for your story. This will determine the setting and characters of your story.
    - Example themes: Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, Mystery, Romance, etc.

- Establish any guidelines for your story. This will determine the tone and style of your story.
    - Example guidelines: 
        - Choose your own adventure story, easy to medium difficulty, characters can die, but will reset to a previous checkpoint, provide several choices for each scene, etc.
        - Choose your own adventure story, hard difficulty, characters can die and will not reset, no pre-defined choices, decisions are made by the player, etc.

- Establish a starting point for your story. This will determine the beginning of your story.


## Additional Features

The AI assistant is able to perform the following actions:

- Get and set bios for the different entities in the story.
    - Entities consist of: "character", "location", "object", and "event".

- Generate visualizations of different aspects of your story, upon request.
    - Examples:
        - Visualize Selene and Dia in front of their ship.
        - Visualize the forest of East Palinore.
